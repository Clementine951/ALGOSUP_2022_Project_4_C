## Steps

1 - Imagine profiles of users (personae) and the way they interact with the school during the day

2 - Write a functional specification

3 - Figure out how to convert the bimx file into something usable with Unity

4 - Provide an architecture diagram and a technical specification

5 - Implement the technical specification and provide working code

6 - The product will be demoed during the oral exam
