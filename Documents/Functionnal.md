## 1. Introduction

### a. Why this project?


This project aims to visualize the future building of ALGOSUP for 2023.

The final project has to be realistic, the user will be able to visit and travel all around this building thanks to a VR headset. The user will see the security of the building and doors but also the room usage, circulation, signage, furniture, storage, toilets, etc.

The virtual setup needs to be as close as possible to the real setup. For instance, if a door has a lock in the real world, it would also require some sort of badge/key in the virtual world, a room that can only fit 10 people in the real world, will have the equivalent capacity in the virtual world, etc.

You need to obey the laws of physics in the virtual world, have no superpowers, can’t walk across walls, fly, etc.

### b. Location

The B3 is located at 16 Rue de la Société Française 18100 Vierzon.

## 2. Definitions of terms

**Virtual Reality** is an expression that designates the devices allowing them to digitally simulate an environment by the machine (computer). Depending on the technologies used, it allows the user to experience a virtual universe through their different senses: most often sight, but also touch, hearing and smell.

**B3** is the name of the building.

**CNAM** means Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, it is an institution dedicated to education, training, and research.

## 3. Building content

Here is the plan for the first floor of this B3.

### d. Handicap access

People with disabilities can go from the parking behind to the building thanks to the elevator next to the stairs.

At the entrance, there are no stairs so, they can come easily. Similarly, there are disabled toilets in women's and men's toilets.

There is an elevator to access the second floor. This elevator will be accessible only to people with disabilities.

### e. Monitoring and security

#### Monitoring

For the monitoring, no video surveillance camera is planned for the moment, but if it's needed, we can place 5 cameras at a strategic place. 

#### Security

The security of the building will be access cards.

The colors of room access are on the building plan.

| Hierarchy |Number of rooms access |Color of room access|
|:--------------- |:-----|:-|
|Open to Everyone|5|Yellow, Salmon, White|
|Second-floor staff|6|Open to everyone, entrance|
|Students|23|Second-floor, orange, pink, dark orange|
|Admin|31|Students, red|
|Admin ++|37|Admin, blue|

Also for security, the building needs to have 12 extinguishers (6 on the first floor, and 6 on the second floor). To explain this, each extinguisher must be installed less than 1.20m from the ground, with a maximum spacing of 30m between two devices. Note that in the event of an identified risk, the extinguisher must be located less than 5m from it.
In addition, it will have an emergency exit sign.
