## 1. Introduction

  

### a. Why this project?

  
  

ALGOSUP will have a new building for 2023, with more space, more features than the current school.

  

To show what the school will look like, ALGOSUP needs a VR simulation of the new place. Our group will do create software that can simulate the exploration to the users of B3 as if they were there. To do this, we must add some realistic features, length, and height of the building, some furniture on the rooms, light, etc.

  

The users need some interaction on the simulation like system key/badge with a mobile application and can open the door with it.

The simulation must obey the laws of physics.

We don’t have any budget but we have to make realistic purchases.

### b. Location

  

The B3 is located at 16 Rue de la Société Française 18100 Vierzon.

## 2. Definitions of terms

  

**Virtual Reality** is an expression that designates the devices allowing them to digitally simulate an environment by the machine (computer). Depending on the technologies used, it allows the user to experience a virtual universe through their different senses: most often sight, but also touch, hearing and smell.

  

**B3** is the name of the building.

  

**CNAM** means Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, it is an institution dedicated to education, training, and research.

  

**AlgoShop** will be a stall placed on the corridor next to the reception. In this little shop, you will find derivative products of ALGOSUP like the ALGOSUP, AlgoSoap, t-shirts, ...

  

## 3. Building content

  

Here is the plan for the first floor of this B3.

  

<img  src="images/plan.jpg"  style="">

  

### a. The goal

  

This building will welcome the four first promotions of students of ALGOSUP on the first floor.

On the second floor, the CNAM, the connected campus, and the incubator will be integrated.

The B3 will welcome 200 students in 2025 and 500 students in 2030.

We have chosen to decorate the B3 with an industrial design with wood to keep the style of the building.

### d. Handicap access

  

People with disabilities can go from the parking behind to the building thanks to the elevator next to the stairs.

  

At the entrance, there are no stairs so, they can come easily. Similarly, there are disabled toilets in women's and men's toilets.

  

There is an elevator to access the second floor. This elevator will be accessible only to people with disabilities.

  

### e. Monitoring and security

  

#### Monitoring

  

For the monitoring, no video surveillance camera is planned for the moment, but if it's needed, we can place 5 cameras at strategic places.

  

#### Security

  

The security of the building will be with the Welcomr application.

|Admin ++|37|Admin, stocks|

  

Also for security, the building needs to have 12 fire extinguishers (6 on the first floor, and 6 on the second floor). To explain this, each fire extinguisher must be installed less than 1.20m from the ground, with a maximum spacing of 30m between two devices. Note that in the event of an identified risk, the fire extinguisher must be located less than 5m from it.

In addition, it will have an emergency exit sign.

#### Visitors:

  

A visitor is coming to visit the school with an admin. They firstly go to the project room closest to the door and here they speak about the course of a project.

#### Others: 


Ava walks in the corridor and sees the ALGOSUP shop in the entrance. The shop offers a wide variety of products such as hoodies and T-shirts. The hoodie costs 60 euros and T-shirts cost 30 euros. The Algosoup is selled at 3 euros and the algosoap is selled at 5 euros. There are also sleeveless jackets at 50 euros and she can also buy mugs with ALGOSUP logo at 10 euros each. It is possible to pay by card or with cash. She decides to take a mug and she pays by card. To pay, she goes to the reception and the person in charge of the reception makes her pay 10 euros for the mug.


Taking into consideration the time needed to go to the toilets which is 1 minute, and considering that each person stays 1 minutes, 130 people could go to the toilets during the same break. This is not enough if the amphitheater is full and each person in it needs to go to the toilets. So, by adding 1 toilet on each side on the first floor, we would reach a capacity of 156 people during a 15 minutes break. This would be enough and not take too much space in the corridor. If we can’t add more toilets a break would need to last at least 16 minutes so that 160 people could go to the toilets.


Regarding the amphitheater, It takes 15 seconds to go from the entrance of the amphitheater to the middle of the last row. When a student arrives, he needs 15 more seconds to sit down and unpack his stuff. Then, his PC is ready to use after 1 minute and a half. So, a student needs 2 minutes to get ready for his lesson, but it would be better if he arrives 3 minutes earlier to be sure to be ready at the start of the lesson.
The amphitheater can be full in approximately 2 minutes counting the time that each student would need to find his place. 
In global, students should enter 5 minutes before the beginning of the class
