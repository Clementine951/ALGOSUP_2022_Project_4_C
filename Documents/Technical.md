## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a virtual school of B3 in 3D, the future premises of ALGOSUP. The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to visit with a virtual reality headset (Oculus Quest 2) and to be able to test all possible movement problems to adapt the layout of the building before moving in. The virtual configuration should be as close as possible to the real configuration.

## 5. VR compatibility

To enable the VR comptability on our project, we need to have the XR plugin management package installed, which can be found on the Unity website. Then, we need to go in XR plugin management in the project settings and choose what kind of VR device will be use. It is an Oculus in our project. Once that is done, we need to attach the main camera of the scene with the object which will represent the user. This can be done at the beginning or once the B3 modelisation is done.

## 6. Possible issues

### Slowness simulation

One of the most dangerous problems can be the slowness of the simulation.
To fix this problem, you can remove all the windows, doors, and furniture from the architect's file and join together all the mesh in Blender. Next, you will have to recreate them in unity.

### Delay for milestones

To avoid these problems, we have decided to not model the second floor. 
Next, the only other solution is to manage the team efficiently thanks to a project execution plan (Trello) to attribute all tasks and put deadlines.

###  Team Leaving

If we have someone leaving the team, someone else will be able to take his work. 
To do that, there will be at least 2 people on each part. 
Also, we ask everyone to push their work every day so we don't lose any work done.

### Knowledge

Nobody in the team knows about Unity. To fix that, you have Sebastien Goisbeault as a teacher that can help.
Here is an exhaustive list of website to use too: 

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Unity Documentation](https://unity.com/fr)
- [C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/csharp/)

## 7. Version 2.0

In the Version 2.0, we thought about adding those functionnalities : 
- You could be able to customise your avatar to make it like you. It could be more realistic for visitors
- Being able to interact with the different NPCs (talk, etc)
- Have an automated visit of the school
- Being able to train for an oral presentation and have feedback 
- Translations into other languages
- Add weather and day-night cycle
- Bug corrections and improved fluidity and stability
- Have a better resolution and image quality
- Being able to write and erase on the board in the classroom 
- Being able to control drones
- Being able to receive in real life what was bought in the simulation (If I buy a hoodie, I will receive it in real life)
- Add extern life (A car passing by, people walking, ...)
- Add the underground, the second floor and the rightest wing
- personalization of project rooms
- Add cameras and being able to see them in Franck office
- Add minigames in function of what they interact with (tennis table, chess...)
- Propose the simulation for open house days
- Extinct fire with the extinguisher
- Being able to take out the garbage
- If someone cuts himself with a knife, he has to use the emergency kit or he would have to go to the hospital and end the simulation
